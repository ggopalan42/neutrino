# People Counter

This people counter simply counts number of poerson in a frame. Meaning it
can double/triple/etc count. 

Also currently there is a aruba version and a wget version. Need to merge it
to a single blob of code.

The models are stored at: /home/ggopalan/work/iot/neutrino/source/apps/people_counter and will later on be moved to dataman1
